# Flutter Timing

This is a simple flutter application for taking down the current time conveniently.
Press the floating button, the current time is recorded in the list.
You can delete, increment or decrement each time record in the list, or clear the list.
It serves both as a demo for studying flutter, and a convenience tool.

The time list is stored using Shared Preferences, which is not expected to store large amount of data.
So, don't keep the records in this application too long.
